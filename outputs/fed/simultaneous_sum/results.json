Do you play a lot of video games?\nUser: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.\nSystem: What do you do in your free time?\nUser: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.\nSystem: Oh cool!

This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML.

The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP.

I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.\nSystem: awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?\nUser: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.\nSystem: Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?\nUser: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?\nSystem: Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.\nUser: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve\nSystem: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.\nUser: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?\nSystem: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?\nUser: Likewise.
